**What did you learn about CSS padding, borders, and margin by doing this challenge?**

Padding and margin are easily understood when referencing the chrome devtoolkit. The tool provides a visual guide for understanding the space required inside the border and outside the border of a div box. Both are important when determining how much space is required in relation to other items on the page.

**What did you learn about CSS positioning?**

Positioning was a more tedious process for me. Through trial and error, I was able to determine how to float and position each of the items on the page. Some of my items are neatly placed in a row, while other lists are stacked in columns.

**What aspects of your design did you find easiest to implement? What was most difficult?**

Sometimes I was clueless when changes were made that I was not expecting. It was difficult to diagnose the issue when using multiple selectors in a CSS line. 

**What did you learn about adding and formatting elements with CSS in this challenge?**

Stay organized. It's easy to lose your place or forget what elements you've changed if you don't carefully place each element you intend to change.
