        <h3>Ruby Classes</h3>
        <p>
          At the end of my first week studying Ruby, I was afraid of classes. It was the most advanced chapter that I had read in The Well-Grounded Rubyist. And when I read it, I hardly understood half of the concepts.
        </p>
        <p>
          What I've come to learn about classes is that they are a cast-mold. Instead of building each object individually, classes provide a quick way to create a new object with pre-defined qualities. I imagine a cast-mold that you can re-use to create a new object, instead of hand carving each one. Overall this saves time and ensures consistent output. 
        </p>
        <h3>My Pet Dog</h3>
        <p>
          If I were to have a house full of pets, I would have to define what qualities each pet would have. All of my birds would have wings and they would chirp. Some could make different sounds, but each would eat similar food. These are all qualities that all pet birds would share. 
        </p>
        <p>
          Likewise, if I had to create each of my pet dogs, instead of creating each dog from scratch, I could first create a class. The class of dogs would all share similar traits. Each would bark, have four legs, and pant when they're tired. If I created a template for each dog, I could quickly create a generic dog and add a few identifying traits. By adding a name, color, size, and intelligence level, I could immediately have a pet that was inherently different than my pet birds. 
        </p>
        <p>
          Notice that I could put the same four instance traits in for every pet, but depending on whether I use a bird class or a dog class, the pet would take on very different qualities. This is the way that I think about classes. It is a simple way to quickly and uniformly create many unique objects in the programming world.
