        <h3>Enumerable Methods: Ruby's most useful module</h3>
        <br>
        <p>
          Enumerable methods include #map, #each, and #select. These methods are similar to #each. And they allow you to apply a method to each element of an array or a hash.
        </p>
        <h3>#each</h3>
        <p>
          returns the original object it was called on because it's really used for its side effects and not what it returns 
        </p>
        <h3>#each_with_index</h3>
        <p>
          passes not just the current item but whatever position in the array it was located in.
        </p>
        <h3>#select</h3>
        <p>
          returns a new object (e.g. array) filled with only those original items where the block you gave it returned true 
        </p>
        <h3>#map</h3>
        <p>
          returns a new array filled with whatever gets returned by the block each time it runs.
