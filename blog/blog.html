<!--
- How was it to wireframe and create an HTML page with a pair?
I thought the process was very easy. Both of us were receptive to new ideas and input. We were able to quickly settle into an overall structure and identify new areas to improve both the usability and visual layout of the page.

- Did you find wireframing to be helpful to your development process?
Yes! Without a picture in hand it would have been incredible hard to convey how I would like something to look. Having a sketch on hand was useful in order to agree or disagree on what we each expected as an outcome. 

- What did you and your pair decide made a good wireframe? 
The ability to see and link to all of the blog posts. Date was also important for the future ability to sort posts by publish date. 

- What new semantic elements did you learn about (if any)?
Linking an image to an email address uses unique input. I was able to use: "href="mailto:noahschutte@gmail.com?Subject=Hey%20Noah!""
