        <h3>Array</h3>
        <p>
          What is an array? Well, an array holds a collection of items. It is simply a list. This list can include numbers (as integers or decimals), boolean statements (true or false), or strings (any text, like "Bob" or "Sally"). 
        </p>
        <p>
          Let's think about a grocery list. If you wanted to list all of the items to shop for, you would have a collection of store bought items that you would need to write down. But, don't you need to include the quantity of each of those items. And aren't each of those quantities directly tied to the item itself? Can an array contain that information?
        </p>
        <h3>Arrays of Arrays</h3>
        <p>
          If an array can contain 2 items, can each of those items be an array? Yes. List A could be ["bananas", "apples"]. If list B included quantities, it would need to look like this [["bananas",6],["apples",3]]. Is there an easier way to store this information? I can't imagine it's easy to access, update or remove information from this list.
        </p>
        <h3>Hashes</h3>
        <p>
          A hash is a collection of key-value pairs. And it accomplishes exactly what we're setting out to do with a grocery list. If our grocery items are unique keys, then each key has a value that is directly tied to that key. A hash would look like this: {"bananas" => 6, "apples" => 4}. This list is not only easier to read, but also can be accessed and updated more readily.
