          <h3>What are the differences between relative, absolute, fixed, and static positioning?</h3>
          <p>
          Content on a webpage is entered as text, links, and images. All of this content is contained in tags that needs to be arranged neatly within a web browser. CSS helps to arrange those tags on the webpage with positioning. There are three unique values that can be used to change the way those tags interact with eachother and arrange themselves on a webpage.
          </p>
          <h4>Display: Inline</h4>
          <p>
            Inline positioned tags can be arranged side by side with other content. They cannot have either a height or width set. They also do not respect top or bottom margin or padding, but will respect left and right margins.
          </p>
          <h4>Display: Block</h4>
          <p>
            Block positioning respects all of the same aspects as inline, except that a line break immediately follows, which does not allow any content to be displayed to the right of the tag.
          </p>
          <h4>Display: Inline-Block</h4>
          <p>
             Inline-block positioning allows other tags to be arranged directly to the right or the left of the tag. They also respect top and bottom margins and padding as well as height and width properties. An example of each positioning is included below:
