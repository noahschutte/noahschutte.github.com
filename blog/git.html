        <h3>What are the benefits of version control?</h3>
        <p>
          Without version control, applications would take years to build. A single developer would have to oversee every feature implementation. Two people could never work on the same project at the same time. New York could build another skyscraper by the time twitter could announce the building's opening. 
        </p>
        <h3>How does the git help you keep track of changes?</h3>
        <p>
          Version control is a process that developers in a team all agree to using. It assures developers that if they borrow a bundle of code to work on all day, their work will fit neatly back in place when they've completed that work. In the meanwhile, other developers are able to work on other portions of code and not step on eachother's toes.  
        </p>
        <h3>Why use GitHub to store your code?</h3>
        <p>
          GitHub is an excellent place to store a project's code, because it is remotely accessible, where many developers can view and access the code at any time. If all code was stored locally, a developer may have to meet you in person to access the most recently updated version of the software. And visit again each and every time they have made any changes to the code.
