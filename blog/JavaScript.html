        <h3>JavaScript</h3>
        <p>
          One of the first things I read about JavaScript was that it did not have classes. This sounded strange to me, considering that JavaScript is also an object oriented language. My concern was that if I am constantly making numerous objects, many of them will have very similar characteristics. But, if I had to make each and every object instance by manually assembling the object properties, I am going to be spending a lot of time re-writing object traits. 
        </p>
        <h3>Constructor Functions</h3>
        <p>
          As it turns out, JavaScript does have something extremely similar to Ruby classes. While completing exercises in JS, I was asked to use a constructor function. I noticed that a constructor function pre-loads the object properties when you call for a new instance of an object. This seemed strangely similar to the purpose of a Ruby class. 
        </p>
        <h3>Syntax</h3>
        <p>
          The difference between Ruby classes and JavaScript constructor functions comes down to syntax. In fact, the most reassuring thing about learning programming so far has been that each and every language has completely unique syntax, but the logic is very much the same. This fact alone gives me the assurance that I am learning a way to communicate with the computer, and the placement of the symbols I use is just a small aspect of that communication.
